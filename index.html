                    <p>Japan's early history dates back to the Jomon period (14000 B.C.-300 B.C.), when a hunter-gatherer
                        society known for pottery. The Yayoi period (300 B.C.-300 A.D.) introduced rice cultivation and
                        metalworking, while the Kofun period (300-538 A.D.) saw the rise of powerful clans. Buddhism arrived
                        in the 6th century, shaping Japanese culture and governance during the Asuka and Nara periods. The
                        Heian period (794-1185 A.D.) was a cultural golden age.</p>
    
                    <p>Feudal Japan emerged in the 12th century, with samurai and shogunates ruling. The Tokugawa Shogunate
                        (1603-1868 A.D.) brought peace and isolation until Western powers forced Japan to open in the
                        mid-19th century. The Meiji Restoration in 1868 led to rapid modernization. Japan became a world
                        power, expanding its empire in the early 20th century but faced defeat in World War II. Today, Japan
                        is a major economic and technological hub.</p>
